Title: A Natural Language Interface to 'ggplot2'
Version: 0.1.0

Description: 'ggplot2' offers a fantastic toolbox for creating and formatting graphs. However, I have terrible memory and I forget the same commands again and again. Like, how do you rotate the x-axis labels again? Or how do you hide the legend...? This package allows you to issue natural language commands related to theme-related styling of plots (colors, font, and such), which then are translated into valid 'ggplot2' commands.
