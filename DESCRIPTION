Title: A Natural Language Interface to 'ggplot2'
Version: 0.1.2

Description: The 'ggplot2' package is the state-of-the-art toolbox for creating and formatting graphs. However, it is easy to forget how certain formatting commands are named and sometimes users find themselves asking: How do you rotate the x-axis labels again? Or how do you hide the legend...? This package allows users to issue natural language commands related to theme-related styling of plots (colors, font size and such), which then are translated into valid 'ggplot2' commands.
