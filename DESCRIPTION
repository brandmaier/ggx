Title: A Natural Langauge Interface to ggplot2
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Andreas M. Brandmaier
Maintainer: Andreas M. Brandmaier <andy@brandmaier.de>
Description: ggplot2 offers a fantastic toolbox for creating and formatting graphs. However, I have terrible memory and I forget the same commands again and again. Like, how do you rotate the x-axis labels again? Or how do you hide the legend...? ggx allows you to issue natural language commands related to theme-related styling of plots (colors, font, and such), which then are translated into valid ggplot commands.
